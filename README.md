# WearableSkinConductanceDevice
VCU BME Senior Design Project (EGRB402 2020)

This repository holds files used for a Senior Design
group to make a wearable skin conductance measuring 
device. The txt files are MatLab files that will graph
data from an excel file on your device. The excel files
show a few samples of data collected from our group. 
Running the matlab code will prompt you to choose an 
excel file to pull data from, and then graph it.

Questions about the code or other aspects of the project 
can be answered by reaching out to burchje@vcu.edu
